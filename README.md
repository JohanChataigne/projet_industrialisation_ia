# Software engineering for AI project : Intent classification

Authors: [Chataigner Johan](https://github.com/JohanChataigne), [Germon Paul](https://github.com/pgermon), and Martin Hugo.

This project is based on its minimal version which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/wiidiiremi/projet_industrialisation_ia_3a).

The first step of the project is to analyze this minimal version to find out what it misses. Then, we basically improve it based on this analysis.

The application offers to the users a classification model that takes their demands (sentences) as input and classifies them into intents.
Based on these intents, the app can ask them for further informations about their request to answer it properly.
