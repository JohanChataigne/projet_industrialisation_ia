# Software engineering for AI project : Intent classification

Authors: [Chataigner Johan](https://github.com/JohanChataigne), [Germon Paul](https://github.com/pgermon), and [Martin Hugo](https://github.com/ScarfZapdos).

This project is based on its minimal version which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/wiidiiremi/projet_industrialisation_ia_3a).

The application offers to the users a classification model that takes their demands (sentences) as input and classifies them into intents.


## Installation

Link to the docker image on DockerHub:


## Content of the project

### Repository tree organization

The repository is composed of the following files and folders:

ðŸ“¦projet_industrialisation_ia  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚app : contains the files to run the application  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚datas : contains the json datasets used to train the model  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚models : contains the model saved  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚notebooks  
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmodel_v1.ipynb : notebook that trains the model  
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œproject_analysis.ipynb : notebook in which we analyze the datasets and model provided  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚obsolete_notebooks  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚preprocessed_data : used to contain files storing the preprocessed data  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚preprocessing  
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œdataset_balancing.py : contains functions used to balance the dataset   
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œpreprocessing.py : contains functions used to preprocessed the dataset  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚test : contains unit tests files   
 â”£ ðŸ“‚threshold :  
   â”£ ðŸ“œthreshold.py : contains functions used to compute the best threshold to be applied for our application    
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œbest_threshold : store the value of the best   threshold computed  
 â”£ ðŸ“œDockerfile  
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md  
 â”— ðŸ“œrequirements.txt  

### Analysis and visualizations

The first step of the project is to analyze the minimal version given to find out what it misses and what can be improved.  
In the notebook `project_analysis.ipynb` we make many visualizations and analysis on the given datasets and model in order to identify the most important metrics to be used to evaluate the performances of the model.
