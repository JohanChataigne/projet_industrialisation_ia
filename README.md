# Software engineering for AI project : Intent classification

Authors: [Chataigner Johan](https://github.com/JohanChataigne), [Germon Paul](https://github.com/pgermon), and [Martin Hugo](https://github.com/ScarfZapdos).

This project is based on its minimal version which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/wiidiiremi/projet_industrialisation_ia_3a).

The application offers to the users a classification model that takes their demands (sentences) as input and classifies them into intents.

### Analysis and visualizations

The first step of the project is to analyze the minimal version given to find out what it misses and what can be improved.  
In the notebook `project_analysis.ipynb` we make many visualizations and analysis on the given datasets and model in order to identify the most important metrics to be used to evaluate the performances of the model.
