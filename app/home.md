# Intent Classification project

Welcome to the Intent Detection API. 

## Description

This API offers the possibility to get the intent predicted by our trained model on a custom sentence. <br>
This will help ro lighten the task of human agents dealing with such requests by automaticaly redirecting users to the right service matching their wishes.<br>

The current available intents are:<br>
- "find-train"<br>
- "find-flight"<br>
- "find-restaurant"<br>
- "purchase"<br>
- "find-around-me"<br>
- "provide-showtimes" <br>
- "find-hotel"<br>

If your request doesn't match any of them, it will be transmitted to a human agent.
